# Printable EV3 Blocks

Here is a set of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 blocks current to firmware v1.07H.
I extracted the bitmaps from LEGO's official firmware release and composed
them back into the blocks. They look exactly like the ones used in the
programmable brick mode.

Each block has a height of 6".  I also included two PSD's (original and printable
sizes) that have layers for each individual component of the blocks.

At Sunset Spark, we use the printable blocks to do group programming on a wall. Enjoy!

See http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads for the official firmware.
